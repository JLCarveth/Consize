# Consize
##Algorithm to summarize articles automatically.
Consize is a Python re-write of a project I made for my Grade 12 final project. Originally written in PHP, Consize takes a large section of text and breaks it down and analyses the content. The algorithm then ranks sentences in the text based on the 'density' of their content and superfluous language eliminated. The data is then restructured and presented in a way that still holds the main idea of the original text.

###Planned Features
- Web Crawler/Scraping to automatically collect and summarize a large number of documents
- Saving/searching submitted articles in a database
- User Web Interface
